# dominion-randomizer
An action card randomizer for the popular card game Dominion.

To solve the problem of bias when selecting the victory cards to play with during a game of Dominion, 
this project will allow you to simply have a randomly generated set of 10 victory cards for the basic game.
At this time, the project only contains the cards from the basic game, but I hope to add more in the future.

## Who's who of How to's
1. Clone the repo to your machine.
2. Run `ruby dominion-randomizer.rb`.
3. Dominate EVERYONE!

## Contributing
If you own a separate version of Dominion and would like to help me add additional cards to the gameplay, please feel free
to fork the project and submit pull requests.

## Important notes
Have fun.
